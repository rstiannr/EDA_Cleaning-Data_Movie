The median (50th percentile) value for the RATING column is 7.1, which indicates a fairly normal distribution of ratings.\n","\n","**VOTES**\n","\n","The minimum value of 5 and the maximum value of 1,713,028 for VOTES suggests that some movies have exceptionally high engagement, though the vast majority likely fall within a more moderate range. With a median of 796, the distribution also appears relatively balanced, though it's worth noting that the presence of extreme values (outliers) could slightly skew the mean.\n","\n","**RunTime**\n","\n","The minimum runtime of 1 minute and the maximum of 853 minutes seems to be reasonable. Given that 75% of the data lies below 95 minutes and the median is 60 minutes, we can expect most movies to have a runtime within a standard length. However, the high variability (standard deviation) suggests that there are some movies with significantly longer durations.\n","\n","**Regarding Missing Values:**\n","\n","The missing values in RATING and VOTES columns, 754 values each, can be replaced by their respective median values to ensure that the data remains consistent. The median is a robust choice for numerical columns like these, as it is less influenced by outliers compared to the mean.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"2z3uGGfz2XD_"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["median_runtime = df['RunTime'].median()\n","df['RATING'].fillna(median_runtime,
