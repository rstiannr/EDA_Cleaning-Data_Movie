Observations:\n","\n","\n","**RATING**\n","\n","The minimum value of 1.1 and the maximum value of 9.9 make sense within the context of movie ratings, as they fall within the expected range for such

The median (50th percentile) value for the RATING column is 7.1, which indicates a fairly normal distribution of ratings.\n","\n","**VOTES**\n","\n","The minimum value of 5 and the maximum value of 1,713,028 for VOTES suggests that some movies have exceptionally high engagement, though the vast majority likely fall within a more moderate range. With a median of 796, the distribution also appears relatively balanced, though it's worth noting that the presence of extreme values (outliers) could slightly skew the mean.\n","\n","**RunTime**\n","\n","The minimum runtime of 1 minute and the maximum of 853 minutes seems to be reasonable. Given that 75% of the data lies below 95 minutes and the median is 60 minutes, we can expect most movies to have a runtime within a standard length. However, the high variability (standard deviation) suggests that there are some movies with significantly longer durations.\n","\n","**Regarding Missing Values:**\n","\n","The missing values in RATING and VOTES columns, 754 values each, can be replaced by their respective median values to ensure that the data remains consistent. The median is a robust choice for numerical columns like these, as it is less influenced by outliers compared to the
