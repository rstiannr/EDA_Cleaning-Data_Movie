Observations:\n","\n","\n","**RATING**\n","\n","The minimum value of 1.1 and the maximum value of 9.9 make sense within the context of movie ratings, as they fall within the expected range for such

With a median of 796, the distribution also appears relatively balanced, though it's worth noting that the presence of extreme values (outliers) could slightly skew the mean.\n","\n","**RunTime**\n","\n","The minimum runtime of 1 minute and the maximum of 853 minutes seems to be reasonable. Given that 75% of the data lies below 95 minutes and the median is 60 minutes, we can expect most movies to have a runtime within a standard length. However, the high variability (standard deviation) suggests that there are some movies with significantly longer durations.\n","\n","**Regarding Missing Values:**\n","\n","The missing values in RATING and VOTES columns, 754 values each, can be replaced by their respective median values to ensure that the data remains consistent. The median is a robust choice for numerical columns like these, as it is less influenced by outliers compared to the
